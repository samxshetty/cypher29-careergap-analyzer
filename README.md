## Problem ##
-
Students and young professionals often struggle to understand why their resumes donâ€™t match industry expectations. They may have some skills but lack visibility into which ones are missing for their target job roles. There is no quick, AI-powered way to analyze career gaps and get personalized guidance
-

## Solution
Career Gap Analyzer is an AI-powered tool that:
- Lets users upload a resume (or paste text)
- Extracts key skills, certifications, and experiences (via Azure Cognitive Services)
- Compares them with a chosen Job Description (JD) using Azure OpenAI embeddings
- Highlights missing skills (gaps) with a clear match percentage
- Suggests a personalized learning path (courses, certifications, projects)
- Built and deployed on Azure App Service for scalability
